# Prey-predator-dynamics-simulation
My attempt to understand the prey-predator ecosystem oh three-species interaction. This project is based on system of Ordinary differential equation (ODEs). The mathematical prediction is done by Lotka-Volterra's equations.

## preypredatormodel_py.py
The mathematical prediction of the  model is a system of 2 coupled ordinary differential equation each representing one species in the ecosystem, one prey and other predator. These equations are based on Lotka-Volterra dynamics.
